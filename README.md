# Recipe-extraction

Problem statement: most recipe websites are unusable due to large, rambling introductions and a barrage of pop-up advertisements that obscure the desired content and slow the website load pace to a crawl.

Some recipe filter programs already exist but are directed towards desktop use. The problem is exacerbated on mobile due to the smaller screen size and inability to use ad-blockers such as uOrigin.

Solution: a web scraper which extracts the desired recipe data from a specified URL and displays it simply on the page. The extracted recipe will be displayed to the user with an emphasis on mobile view.

Features:

- URL search
- Text only
- Ingredients list
  - Resizable recipe (multiply by factor)
- Recipe steps
